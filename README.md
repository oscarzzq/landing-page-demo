## **Project Overview**

The website follows a classic landing page structure, featuring several distinct sections:

* A header with a logo and navigation links.  
* A "hero" section with a strong call to action.  
* An information section with text and illustrations.  
* An inspiring quote section.  
* A final call-to-action banner.  
* A simple footer.

## **Technologies Used**

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.  
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including layout, fonts, and colors.  
  * **Flexbox:** Used extensively for arranging elements and creating a responsive layout.

This project is intentionally built without any JavaScript to focus purely on static page design and layout skills.

## **Setup**

No special setup is required. To view the project, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

## **Acknowledgements**

This project was built as a demonstration of skills learned and is a great template for anyone starting with HTML and CSS.
